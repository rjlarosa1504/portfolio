# Welcome!
Hello! Welcome to my Data Science/ Machine Learning portfolio. My name is Renzo La Rosa and I am a data scientist/machine learning engineer.
Data science and machine learning are topics I am very passionate about, but it wasn't where I started my career. In fact, I didn't know what
data science was until I was already in the workforce! Here's a quick summary of my background (feel free to skip to the **Portfolio** section
if you'd like)

# Background
My background is in engineering. I graduated with honors from Purdue University in Indianapolis with a Mechanical Engineering degree, minoring
in Mathematics. My internship and co-op experiences at companies like UTC and Rolls-Royce led me to pursue graduate school at Virginia Tech, 
where I graduated with a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering as well. I went to work at Rolls-Royce full-time after graduation as a
Performance Engineer where my primary projects involved thermodynamic modelling. Needless to say, I loved using data to create models. After
conversations with my mentor, I found that Data Science was the career for me.

# Breaking Through to Data Science/ML
I continued to excel at my role while expanding my knowledge after work through practical projects like Codecademy and reading "Towards Data
Science". I got Codecademy certified in Python and SQL and in my networking I found opportunities at my current company (Deloitte) where I am 
a Data Science Consultant. In my time here, I have developed and continue developing machine learning models in credit risk and athlete performance
spaces. In my spare time, I continue to expand my knowledge through my M.S. in Computer Science specializing in Machine Learning program at 
Georgia Tech, as well as Udemy courses and personal projects. I am determined to be an expert in the field.

# Portfolio
My portfolio consists of concepts that I have used in the past to solve problems whether at work (Rolls-Royce & Deloitte) or graduate projects
(Georgia Tech). 

**NOTE: Concepts in portfolio are not limited to my abilities**

The portfolio is broken down into concept folders:
- Regression (linear, KNN, random forest, AdaBoost)
- Classification
- Clustering
- PCA
- Deep Learning
- Big Data
- Data Cleaning
