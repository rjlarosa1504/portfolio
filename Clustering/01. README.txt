clustering.py uses Kaggle data (insurance.csv) to show insights/anomalies in the data

PCA analysis was done to reduce the dimensions. COS2 values represent the quality of the representative data.
The COS2 values showed that smoking status had the highest quality of representation, followed by age and bmi.

Clustering analyses were done with 2 to 5 clusters. The plots showed that smoking was the primary factor that
impacted clustering (and insurance charges), followed by BMI. 

Insights gathered from clustering analysis:

- From a company perspective:
--- Cluster analysis show that a smoker with high BMI has highest insurance cost. If there is a person that fits
--- these criteria but have low insurance cost, then this anomaly ought to be addressed. The company is taking on
--- a higher risk by charging them too low.

- From a personal perspective:
--- On the opposite spectrum, if there is a person who is non-smoker and low BMI and are paying high insurance charges,
--- then it may a good opportunity to negotiate insurance charges with current company or shop around for other insurances.
