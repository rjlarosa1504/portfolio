regression.py uses Kaggle data (insurance.csv) to demonstrate different types of regression analyses. The
analyses included are:

1. linear regression
Simple linear regression is used as the baseline. Future regression analyses attempt at having a better result

2. k-nearest neighbor (KNN)
A plot was created to find the impact of number of neighbors and R-squared. As expected the lower the number of
nearest neighbors, the higher the R-squared and regression. Unfortunately, even with nearest neighbor of 2 (a 
number that would be overfitted anyway) the resulting R-squared did not reach 0.8.

3. random forest regression
A plot was created to find the impact of leaf size and R-squared. As expected the lower the leaf size, the higher
the R-squared. In this case however, the R-squared was high for a range of leaf sizes. The author proceeded with 
a leaf size of 5 with an R-squared value > 0.9

4. AdaBoost regression
AdaBoost regression resulted in 0.8 < R-square < 0.9.

These results suggest that there may be a difference in insurance charges depending on region or gender. Further analysis
is needed to prove or refute the hypothesis. Clustering analysis (unsupervised learning) will be done in a different script.
